    <div class="container">
        <h2>Continued Demand for Residential Real Estate</h2>
        <p>Residential real estate remains a hot commodity in 2024. The desire for homeownership persists, especially among millennials and Gen Z buyers entering the market. This demographic shift is prompting an increase in demand for various types of properties, including single-family homes and townhouses.

    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Rise of Hybrid Workspaces</h2>
        <p>The impact of remote work on the real estate market cannot be understated. As many companies embrace hybrid work models, homebuyers are prioritizing properties that can accommodate a home office or flexible living spaces.

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Emphasis on Sustainable Living</h2>
        <p>Sustainability is becoming a vital consideration for homebuyers. As environmental awareness increases, buyers are seeking energy-efficient homes with eco-friendly features. This trend includes properties with solar panels, high-efficiency appliances, and sustainable building materials. Many buyers are also interested in homes that offer smart technology to monitor energy usage.

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Urban vs. Suburban Living</h2>
        <p>The trend of moving from urban to suburban areas remains strong in 2024. Many homebuyers are reevaluating their living situations, prioritizing space, affordability, and community.

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Shift Towards Rental Properties</h2>
